# Handouts Plugin

This unofficial TaleSpire plugin which allows web and local handouts (images) to be shared to all clients.

## Install

Use R2ModMan to install the plugin.

Place any local images in a TaleSpire_CustomData folder inm your main game TaleSpire folder. This folder is
not part of the core game so it may not exist. If it does not, just create it. However, this folder is used
by many Lord Ashes plugins so if the folder already exists just copy your images into that folder.

Note: When using local images, all clients must have those images installed locally.

## Usage

Once a board has loaded use the triggering shortcut to activate. This shortcut is configurable in R2ModMan
but defaults to LeftControl+H (for handout).

This will open a dialog box.

To use web URL type the entire URL. Make sure that the URL starts with HTTP (or HTTPS). 
To use a local image, type the image name without the path or the extension.  

## Change Log

1.0.3: Expected local handout images are now expected in TaleSpire_CustomData/Images
